# Things that needs to be done

## Home Page

### Filter / Search Bar

Okay, firstly I want a filter / search bar at the top of the page

This will allow the user to filter the recipes by many different things, such as: name, cooking_time, nutrition, tags, etc.

### Recipe List

Then I want a list of all the recipes to be displayed below the search bar (in a grid format would be good) with a small image of the recipe, the name of the recipe, the cooking time, and the nutrition information.

I don't know how exactly I want to do this, but I want the user to be able to click on a recipe & be taken to a page with more information about that recipe on it, including the ingredients

### Recipe Selection

I want the user to be able to select recipes, & then generate a shopping list from the selected recipes

This will mean it's important that if the user leaves & comes back to the page, that the selected recipes are still selected

## Recipe Page

I don't really know what to do here just yet, but something can be done

## About Ingredients

Maybe it would be good to call some API that has information about the ingredients that exist in stores, so that the user can like scan the barcode & ingredient information comes up

This would be good so that I can model that data within my database

## Shopping List Page

When the user generates the shopping list, I of course want them to be able to view & edit it

This way, they can remove items they already have, or add items they want to buy
